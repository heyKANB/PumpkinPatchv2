# App Tracking Transparency Verification

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **NSUserTrackingUsageDescription** - Added to Info.plist
✅ **ATTrackingManager Import** - Added to AppDelegate.swift  
✅ **Request Authorization** - Implemented in applicationDidBecomeActive
✅ **Privacy Manifest** - Created PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
✅ **iOS Deployment Target** - Set to 14.5+ (required for ATT)

## Implementation Details

### Info.plist Configuration
```xml
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app would like to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites to provide personalized ads and improve your gaming experience.</string>
```

### Native iOS Code (AppDelegate.swift)
- Imports: `AppTrackingTransparency` and `AdSupport` frameworks
- Authorization request triggered 1 second after app becomes active
- Handles all authorization states: authorized, denied, restricted, notDetermined
- Logs IDFA when tracking is authorized

### Privacy Compliance
- Privacy manifest includes tracking domains and data collection types
- Proper authorization status handling
- Clear user-facing description of tracking purpose

## Troubleshooting

If you see "NSUserTrackingUsageDescription key must be in the Information Property List":

1. Verify Info.plist contains the key (✅ confirmed present)
2. Ensure iOS deployment target is 14.5+ (✅ updated to 14.5)
3. Check that AppTrackingTransparency framework is linked
4. Rebuild the project after changes

## Testing

When the app launches on iOS 14.5+:
1. User sees system tracking permission dialog
2. App logs the user's choice to console
3. IDFA is available if user grants permission
4. Tracking events are logged based on authorization status
